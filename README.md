# Day Planner

## Description

- In today's busy era, it is fairly easy to forget about our todo list. So this gave me an idea to create a day planner in which you can write the jobs you want to accomplish. 

- To achieve my goal, I created this application. In it you can write the important jobs which you want to accomplish, but you are affraid that you will forget them.

- It will make the hectic life of today's human a bit easy. Thus giving them a siegh of relief, as they do not have to remember everything which need to be done on that specific day.

-Java script and Jquery were totally new to me, so I learned them and used them in a way which enhances my understanding of them.

## How to contribute

You can always look at the HTML code and the CSS styling  which I use. I trust myself completely; however, not a single man on this earth is perfect, so if you find a better way to code the Day planner, or find any fault in my code, feel free to contact me on Linkedin, Github and Gmail, all you have to do is to search my name- Sachmilan Singh.
